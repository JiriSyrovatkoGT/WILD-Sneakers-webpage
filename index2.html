                <h2>
                    The Jordan 1 remains popular because it is iconic, looks great with any number of outfits and is directly tied to the history of sneaker collecting in general. 
                    Limited availability and hype of course also plays a role.
                    Being the first model in the series of Jordan Brand releases with countless different colorways and form factors (low, mid, high, etc) gives the sneaker both niche history and wide appeal at the same time. 
                    If you are just getting into collecting sneakers, it seems like a “must” to own at least one pair of AJ1s.
                    In fact, the Air Jordan 1 is widely assumed to be the origin of sneaker culture. A debatable claim given that the Air Force 1 initially released a couple years earlier. 
                    And despite the Air Ship being the first Nike that Michael Jordan technically wore in the NBA. 
                    Peter Moore designed the model and came up with the iconic “wings” logo.
                    We can all agree that hype helps drive sneaker popularity and sales. 
                    The Jordan 1 is and has been one of the most hyped shoes out there, with celebrities and influencers seen rocking the sneakers to this day. 
                    This definitely contributes to certain colorways selling out and being more difficult to find for retail.

                The Jordan 1 would eventually hit the vault until 1995 when the first series of retros released. 
                These had lackluster sales at the time and often went straight to clearance racks! The world wasn’t ready for the AJ1 retro just yet. 
                However, when retros again surfaced in 2001, the popularity was way more palpable. 
                Since then, the Air Jordan 1 has released in countless colorways to great success, as sneaker culture has grown up right alongside the model.

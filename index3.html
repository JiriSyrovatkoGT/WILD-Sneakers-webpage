                    The Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 is not like them. 
                    It is far from classic in design. 
                    Yet the Kanye West-designed shoe is one of the most hyped trainers in recent memory, and those who like them really like them.

            <h2>
                The adidas Yeezy Boost 350 v2 is a decade-defining sneaker designed by Kanye West and adidas. 
                Given that from one release to the next, the Yeezy inventory continues to sell out instantly, the sneaker has certainly captured the attention of the mainstream audience, and its demand is through the roof. 
                From a constructional standpoint, they feature an elastic upper comprised of the Three Stripes' signature Primeknit material, while its bottom regions are comprised with rib-like molds that house its interior Boost midsole cushioning. 
                Some of its earlier iterations were decorated with “SPLY-350” text hits on its traditional stripe, but variations in recent years have instead opted to keep things to a cleaner aesthetic.
                Easily one of, if not the most popular adidas Yeezy shoe West has ever created, it made its official debut back in September 24th, 2016 with its grey and orange “Beluga” colorway. 
                Since then the silhouette has gone on to release in a wide array of different colorways, as well as seen through to several restocks; all of which have sold out completely once arriving on the retail market. 
                In 2019, adidas introduced “Reflective” versions of the silhouette which happen to be much more limited than the non-reflective styles as many of them were Yeezy Supply exclusives.

            <h2>
                Sneakers can be about style, history and even community. 
                A new study reveals that for “Sneakerheads,” sneakers are an important facet of their identities, particularly for African-American men who grew up in the 1970s and 80s coveting sneakers popularized by hip-hop stars and basketball legends.
                In the journal Fashion and Textiles, researchers report new insights into the motivations, brand preferences and identity considerations of Sneakerheads. 
                The findings were drawn from interviews with 12 men in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, many whom are African-American, and all whom self-identified as Sneakerheads. 
                The findings help inform marketing efforts, and help fill a void in academic literature on the topic.
                “As a researcher who looks at consumer behavior and trends that apply to my industry in fashion and apparel, any sort of trend that is out there getting a lot of attention, I am drawn to,” said the studys lead author Delisia Matthews, assistant professor of textile brand management and marketing at North Carolina State Universitys Wilson College of Textiles.“
                I want to know the why behind a trend. 
                What is motivating people to go after a particular trend? 
                What are the drivers and the brand preferences?”
                In the article, researchers described the history of Sneakerhead sub-culture and defined what it means to be one: to have a strong interest in sneaker history, to seek out rare and exclusive sneaker collections and to admire, collect - and sometimes re-sell - sneakers.
                Based on the interviews, three themes emerged about the motivations and preferences of Sneakerheads. The first theme, which the researchers called “Back in the Day,” references the importance of history to Sneakerheads. 
                Matthews said many Sneakerheads trace the origin of the movement to the 1970s and 80s, when sneakers were popularized by basketball icon Michael Jordan, and also by hip-hop stars who were known not just for their unique rhythms, rhymes and lyrics, but also for their style or their “swag.”
                “I think one of the key pivotal groups that focused on sneakers would be Run-DMC,” Matthews said. 
                “One of the shoes they made popular were the Adidas Shell Toes. 
                It was a staple, and they even made a song about it. 
                People were paying attention not only to what was coming out of their mouths, but also what they were wearing.”
                The second theme, “All About the Jumpman,” references the importance of Jordan and the release of the Nike Air Jordan Is in 1985. 
                The logo is now the “Jumpman,” and Matthews said the Nike Air Jordan Is are, “the gateway into being a Sneakerhead.”
